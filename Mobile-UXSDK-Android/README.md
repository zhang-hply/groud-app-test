# DJI UX SDK for Android

## What is This?

The UX SDK is a suite of product agnostic UI objects that fast tracks the development of Android applications using the [DJI Mobile SDK](http://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/).

## Integration

Declare dependency via Maven:

~~~xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.dji</groupId>
    <artifactId>dji-uxsdk</artifactId>
    <version>4.12</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.dji</groupId>
    <artifactId>dji-sdk-provided</artifactId>
    <version>4.12</version>
</dependency>
~~~

or Gradle:

~~~groovy
implementation ('com.dji:dji-uxsdk:4.12', {
    /**
     * Comment the "library-anti-distortion" if your app does need Anti Distortion for Mavic 2 Pro and Mavic 2 Zoom.
     * Comment the "fly-safe-database" if you do not need database for release, or we will download it when DJISDKManager.getInstance().registerApp
     * is called.
     * Both will greatly reducing the size of the APK.
     */
    exclude module: 'library-anti-distortion'
    exclude module: 'fly-safe-database'

    /**
     * Uncomment the following line to exclude amap from the app.
     * Note that Google Play Store does not allow APKs that include this library.
     */
    // exclude group: 'com.amap.api'
})
compileOnly ('com.dji:dji-sdk-provided:4.12')

## Extended content
This project is based on Mobile-UXSDK-Android. The changes are mainly in [CompleteWidgetActivity.java](https://github.com/zhang-hply/groud-app-test/blob/master/Mobile-UXSDK-Android/sample/app/src/main/java/com/dji/ux/sample/CompleteWidgetActivity.java) and [res folder](https://github.com/zhang-hply/groud-app-test/tree/master/Mobile-UXSDK-Android/sample/app/src/main/res). Some UI, such as camera, have been deleted due to no room on screen to extend our UI. Showing the distance between UAV and obstacle in six directions, showing the capacity of tank and the switchs of ordering UAV to stop instantly and execute the task autonomously is added. The app has to be deployed together with OnBoard SDK. The functions that communicate with Onboard SDK are **setOnboardSDKDeviceDataCallback** and **sendDataToOnboardSDKDevice**.
